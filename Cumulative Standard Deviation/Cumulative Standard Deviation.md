Cumulative standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion or variability of a dataset as it accumulates over time or as new data points are added. It helps you understand how the spread of data changes as you incorporate more observations. To calculate the cumulative standard deviation, you'll need to keep track of the mean and variance as you add each new data point.

Here's the formula for calculating the cumulative standard deviation:

```
Cumulative Standard Deviation (σ_cumulative) = sqrt(Σ[(X_i - μ_cumulative)^2] / N)
```

Where:
- σ_cumulative is the cumulative standard deviation.
- X_i is each individual data point.
- μ_cumulative is the cumulative mean.
- N is the number of data points.

Here's a Python code snippet to calculate the cumulative standard deviation as you add new data points:

```python
import math

def cumulative_std_dev(data):
    cumulative_mean = 0  # Initialize the cumulative mean
    cumulative_variance = 0  # Initialize the cumulative variance
    cumulative_std_deviation = []  # List to store cumulative standard deviations

    for i, x in enumerate(data, 1):
        # Update the cumulative mean
        cumulative_mean = (cumulative_mean * (i - 1) + x) / i

        # Update the cumulative variance
        cumulative_variance = (cumulative_variance * (i - 1) + (x - cumulative_mean) ** 2) / i

        # Calculate the cumulative standard deviation
        cumulative_std_dev = math.sqrt(cumulative_variance)

        cumulative_std_deviation.append(cumulative_std_dev)

    return cumulative_std_deviation

# Example usage:
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
cumulative_std = cumulative_std_dev(data)
print(cumulative_std)
```

In this code:

- `cumulative_mean` keeps track of the cumulative mean as new data points are added.
- `cumulative_variance` keeps track of the cumulative variance as new data points are added.
- `cumulative_std_deviation` is a list that stores the cumulative standard deviations after each data point is added to the sequence.

The function `cumulative_std_dev` takes a list of data points as input and returns a list of cumulative standard deviations. You can add new data points to the `data` list, and the function will update the cumulative standard deviation accordingly.

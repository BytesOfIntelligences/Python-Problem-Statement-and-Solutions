Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. It works by maintaining a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source vertex is known and continually updates the distance values of the remaining vertices as it explores the graph.

Here is a high-level overview of Dijkstra's algorithm:

1. Create a list to store the shortest distance from the source vertex to each vertex in the graph. Initialize the distance of the source vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.

2. Create a set to keep track of visited vertices.

3. While there are unvisited vertices:
   a. Select the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance from the source vertex. This can be done using a priority queue or a min-heap data structure.
   b. Mark the selected vertex as visited.
   c. For each neighbor of the selected vertex that is unvisited:
      - Calculate the distance from the source vertex to the neighbor through the selected vertex.
      - If this distance is shorter than the current known distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance value.
   
4. Repeat step 3 until all vertices have been visited.

Now, let's implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, source):
    # Initialize distances and visited set
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[source] = 0
    visited = set()
    
    # Create a priority queue to store vertices and their distances
    priority_queue = [(0, source)]
    
    while priority_queue:
        # Get the vertex with the smallest distance from the priority queue
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        # Skip if already visited
        if current_vertex in visited:
            continue
        
        # Mark the current vertex as visited
        visited.add(current_vertex)
        
        # Update the distances to neighbors
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example usage:
graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

source_vertex = 'A'
shortest_distances = dijkstra(graph, source_vertex)
print("Shortest distances from", source_vertex, "to each vertex:", shortest_distances)
```

In this example, we have a weighted graph represented as a dictionary, where the keys are vertices, and the values are dictionaries of neighboring vertices and their edge weights. The `dijkstra` function returns the shortest distances from the source vertex 'A' to all other vertices in the graph.
